			"tag" : "1,000 years of commodity prices",
			"intro" : "For Adam Matthew Digital's Global Commodities collection, we created this interactive visualization of commodity prices across the world through history. Users can compare prices of hundreds of different commodities in hundreds of markets and different time periods. Want to know how the price of ginger in the USA in 1817 compares to the price of copper in France in 1640? Now you can find out!",
			"data" : "The visualization represents over 127,000 price values for 414 commodities across 245 markets over a span of about one thousand years. The price data, along with some information about each market and commodity, are stored in a database on the server. We wrote a simple API to allow us to retrieve data for specific combinations of commodity, market, and time span.",
			"design" : "We fashioned this as a classic geovisualization, with coordinated displays that each reflect selections made in the others. To make sense of the thousands of data points, we designed a system with three primary modes: comparison of commodities, comparison of markets, and comparison of time periods. In each mode several selections can be made, which then update the map and charts. A desaturated interface helps the brightly colored selections show up clearly.",
			"code" : "Most of this visualization was built around D3.js. D3's core data binding functions, along with its graphical capabilities, were ideal for these charts, which are constantly updated with new data values. Its support for geographic data furthermore was useful for the map component, allowing us to avoid yet another Mercator tiled map and instead use a more appropriately projected and simplified map for global and continental scales."

			"intro" : "",
			"data" : "The map is based on two types of data. First are news stories related to climate change. The stories are regularly and automatically collected from Google News feeds, geocoded to relevant locations by a GeoNames service, and then stored in a Google table. The second data type is more traditional geographic point data—except that it's represented in hexagonal bins. These data are on two general topics, weather and industrial emissions.",
			"design" : "",
			"code" : "The map is built on the Google Maps API with a PHP back end for the news aggregator and connection to Google tables. On top of the standard Google Maps functionality we built a custom extension for a hexagonal grid. The HexGrid module takes point data (as well as display options) and generates a grid of polygon overlays representing either simple bins or and interpolated surface of cells."

			"intro" : "Taking advantage of IPRO's Pellucid database of healthcare indicators and built with HTML 5 and JavaScript, this second-generation map allows users to explore numerous indicators of care at the state, county, HRR, and hospital level. Users can view and filter data distributions via the histogram, add hospital and physician overlays, and control the classification and color scheme applied to the choropleth map. The new map is fully integrated with the Why Not The Best site, allowing users to link out to more detailed reports and return to the map exactly as they left it.",
			"data" : "IPRO's Pellucid database contains data for many quality of health care measures in counties, states, hospitals, and hospital regions. We designed the map to be fully driven by this database so that data changes do not require changes to the map.",
			"design" : "The central design challenge was to make a map that can support any number of variables for different levels of geography and different types of geometry (points and areas), all without being overwhelming and confusing to the user. We designed an interface that is fairly simple for basic usage but can grow more complex if the user dives deeper by adding overlays, zooming to a street-level map, or changing symbolization options.",
			"code" : "Originally built in Flash, the map was rebuilt from the ground up using HTML and JavaScript. Powering the map is the open source library Leaflet, which is supplemented by tiled canvas layer to draw the choropleth layers. The geographic data is served by TileStache and symbolized according to data retrieved from remote data services."

			"intro" : "As part of the New York Times' special report on the 10-year anniversary of September 11, 2001, we built this map of user-generated data that displays more than 40,000 interactive points indicating where people were on that day. Visitors to the map drop a pin to add their own location and short comment. All users' locations are shown as dots colored according to their specified mood after reflection on the past decade, and filtering and search controls allow for more specific views. Built-in links to post on Twitter and Facebook facilitate sharing users' stories with others.",
			"data" : "Unlike most of our projects, this map started with no data. All the data were user-generated after the map launch. Each data point consisted of a location, a selected emotion, and a comment. Developers at the Times built a database to collect and store the points, which were delivered to the map as a single file that was updated every few minutes.",
			"design" : "The map's design, largely a product of the Times graphics talent, is in line with the typical NYT aesthetic: light and clean. One design challenge was to give an accurate impression of the relative number of points in different cities at distant zoom levels (where, say, a thousand points in New York would look the same as a hundred points in Seattle). To achieve this we allow some dispersal of overlapping points—some geographic accuracy is sacrificed but it better conveys the intended impression.",
			"code" : "We built this map during the final days of Flash in NYT graphics. It uses the now-deprecated Google Maps API for Flash with a few custom elements on top. The map points are not drawn with the API but rather as a separate raster object. It was important that the map be fast, and Flash performs well here. 40,000 vector points would grind the map to a halt, but drawing them to a single raster layer does not. Interactivity is faster too by constantly checking the mouse location for proximity to points rather than creating many mouse event listeners."

			"intro" : "This map, in partnership with Adam Matthew Group, explores both the place and space of Victorian London through historic data and primary source documents. Users can view historic basemaps in a modern context, examine London's changing urban population, and explore historic images of the city. Finally, a historic street view feature lets users look around the streets of Victorian London.",
			"data" : "Assembled in this map is a variety of data types: standard thematic data, historic maps, documents, photographs, and street sketches.",
			"design" : "To accommodate the various types of data, we designed the map with several different modes, each depicting one or a group of data types. The look of the map and interface, including a base map design done with Cloudmade, evokes maps of the Victorian era. Perhaps the most interesting design was for the Tallis sketches of city blocks, which were subtly enhanced and brought into a 3D environment to create a pseudo “Street View” that we're all used to in Google Maps.",
			"code" : "London Low Life was our first major project done with HTML and JavaScript. Let's just say we learned a lot of lessons! The map is built upon OpenLayers. Some of what was learned from writing code for thematic overlays in this project was eventually refined into a more complete thematic mapping extension for OpenLayers."

			"tag" : "Elegant and flexible cartography",
			"intro" : "We worked with the Boston region's Metropolitan Area Planning Council to design a set of Massachusetts basemap tiles for use in their various web maps. The multiscale map is designed to be distinctive yet neutral, providing reference information but not distracting from data overlays. It was designed in TileMill using state GIS data, and the styles and tiles are freely available from the MAPC.",
			"data" : "Layered into this basemap are a number of reference data sets from MassGIS, the state's GIS data repository. For maximum speed and flexibility, the source shapefiles were loaded into a PostGIS database, allowing very specific queries in the definition of TileMill layers.",
			"design" : "We aimed for a design that would let the map stand on its own as a reference map but also be subtle enough to support additional overlays of thematic or other reference layers. Low saturation and light colors for roads, labels, etc. ensure that the basemap doesn't interfere too much with anything on top of it, but there's just enough color and contrast to make the map work decently by itself too.",
			"code" : "Since this map was designed in TileMill, the code is CartoCSS styling. This was a good exercise in the complexity of stylesheets required for street map design. Styles often need to be repeated and intricately nested a for single layer, for example to correctly stack different road levels, including bridges and tunnels, and apply a casing to all of them—and do so differently for different zoom levels."

			"intro" : "To help evaluate the effectiveness of their programs, the Duke University Children's Environmental Health Initiative contacted us to build a visualization system that lets them compare health, demographic and program data. The dual, linked choropleth maps display separate variables that can be manipulated using the adjoining histogram and pie charts. The system is fully extensible so CEHI's GIS staff can continue to add and update their own data as it becomes available.",
			"data" : "[er, what exactly is the origin and purpose of the data?] The data are stored in shapefiles and several DBFs, directly readable by the map. Because many of the attributes can be filtered by race and sex, we needed to create a complete data model (in the form of an XML file) that spells out all the filter combinations, attribute names, and the DBF columns to which they refer.",
			"design" : "Comparison is the name of the game: everything comes in pairs so that experts can easily make comparisons between data sets. A customized base map (enhanced with some vector data) was designed with CloudMade. A low-key but challenging design task here was to allow the view to be printed. We often rely on interactivity to show all the data, but here we also designed a view for printing that was stripped down yet still contained all necessary information.",
			"code" : "We built this map on the indiemapper platform, a fully capable system for thematic mapping in Flash. The same code that powers indiemapper itself, allowing us to load geodata and have full, flexible control over symbology and style, powers this map. We extended it further by integrating Modest Maps for."

On the iPad, however, the focus was weighted more heavily on simplicity and ease of use. A set of core features allow users to select health indicators, tap counties and HRRs to obtain unit-specific reports, and choose the number of data classes and color scheme of the map display. We drew on the jQuery Mobile framework for a polished, iPad-app look and feel."
