# MAPC Basemap
We worked with the Boston region's Metropolitan Area Planning Council to design a set of Massachusetts basemap tiles for use in their various web maps. The multiscale map is designed to be distinctive yet neutral, providing reference information but not distracting from data overlays. It was designed in TileMill using state GIS data, and the styles and tiles are freely available from the MAPC.

# Duke CEHI
To help evaluate the effectiveness of their programs, the Duke University Children's Environmental Health Initiative contacted us to build a visualization system that lets them compare health, demographic and program data. The dual, linked choropleth maps display separate variables that can be manipulated using the adjoining histogram and pie charts. The system is fully extensible so CEHI's GIS staff can continue to add and update their own data as it becomes available.

# London Lowlife
This map, in partnership with Adam Matthew Group, explores both the place and space of Victorian London through historic data and primary source documents. Users can view historic basemaps in a modern context, examine London's changing urban population, and explore historic images of the city. Finally, a historic street view feature lets users look around the streets of Victorian London.

# WNTB Tablet
This is the tablet version of our Why Not the Best desktop map. Like on the desktop, this web map allows users to explore nationwide indicators of health care at the state, county, or HRR level. On the iPad, however, the focus was weighted more heavily on simplicity and ease of use. A set of core features allow users to select health indicators, tap counties and HRRs to obtain unit-specific reports, and choose the number of data classes and color scheme of the map display. We drew on the jQuery Mobile framework for a polished, iPad-app look and feel.

# Romanticism
This interactive map is the fourth partnership between Adam Matthew Digital and Axis Maps LLC. Users can explore locations important to the lives and works of romantics, artists, and writers who visited and lived in the Lake District--the mountainous region in North West England that inspired their creativity. Locations are organized thematically into five separate guided tours. A custom-made media browser linked to each location contains an image viewer and audio player for examining original documents and listening to excerpts from the literature.

# China Chronology
We designed and built this chronology of Chinese history (1637-1937) as part of an Adam Matthew Digital project covering the Wason Pamphlet Collection at Cornell University. Users can scroll down the chronology or use the interactive histogram-timeline at the top of the page to jump to a particular year of interest. The chronology can also be filtered down by a range of possible themes (e.g., arts and culture) and is fully text searchable.

# First World War
This project with Adam Matthew Digital includes fourteen animated maps of the key fronts, battles and campaigns of World War I. Three additional interactive maps invite users to explore the war in terms of its global context (e.g., effects of the war on national boundaries). The maps have been arranged along a master timeline that provides temporal context as well as serving as a central navigational element. A selection of primary source documents is available for viewing alongside the maps using a built in image viewer.

# Rock & Roll Chronology
This interactive chronology was a collaborative project with Adam Matthew Digital. It features significant events in music, politics, fashion and youth culture in Britain and America between 1950-1975. Users can browse articles and images over time using an interactive timeline, as well as filter entries by particular themes and artist names. A linked bubble visualization shows the number of events in the chronology broken down by theme (i.e., bubbles) across the time period.

# Imagining the Israeli-Palestinian Border
In conjunction with The Washington Institute for Near East Policy's <a href='http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/templateC04.php?CID=301' target='_blank'>Imagining the Border</a> project, this map was developed to allow users to explore different Israeli / Palestinian land swap proposals. Complicated linework is loaded dynamically via KML and users can customize the display by adjusting the transparency of each option. Extensive settlement / community data is searchable by name to locate individual settlements in a large dataset.

# Dekorra Economic Development Map
Working with <a href='http://www.vandewalle.com/' target='_blank'>Vandewalle & Associates</a>, we built an interactive town map as part of the Dekorra Economic Development Opportunities Improvement Initiative. This map, built with the open-source OpenLayers library, combines Google base maps with the town's parcel data to allow users to explore the 3 economic focus zones in the town of Dekorra. The map allows users to search and filter properties based on characteristics such as parcel size and cost and retrieve detailed information and photos for each parcel on-the-fly.

# Deathâ€™s Door Spirits Locator
This Google Maps mashup was built for Death's Door Spirits to help visitors to their website find locations to purchase their spirits. It uses a Google Map style unique to Death's Door, based on their bottle design. Users can dynamically search by location and location type and get directions to their closest craft spirits distributor.

# Border Fence Map
Popular Mechanics contacted Axis Maps to produce a map to be featured in their 4-page spread for their article titled: 'Fixing the U.S. Border Fence' in their August, 2010 issue. This map shows the location and condition of the U.S. / Mexico border fence and was designed around the page-layout and graphic style of both the article and issue.

# CaGIS Website
The Cartographic and Geographic Information Society hired us to completely revamp their graphic identity and online presence. We worked with them to craft their message and turn that into a standards compliant website. We also migrated their existing Excel database online and built tools to help their members to automatically pay for and manage their accounts online and CaGIS administrators to manage their growing database.

# Sitra Dymaxion Map
This map was produced for Sitra, the Finnish Innovation Fund, to allow their graphic designers to quickly add thematic information to an attractive basemap. We used the Fuller projection, placing Finland at the center of the map.

# UW Arboretum Map
The University of Wisconsin Arboretum map was built with the central focus of engaging users who use the arboretum for everything from research to recreation. Users can add their own content to the map by uploading photos to Flickr or recording their experiences in Google My Maps. Researchers and arboretum staff can add their own research to the map through data managed and maintained by the arboretum staff through a flexible interface designed by Axis Maps that allows for a wide range of styling and even map animation.
